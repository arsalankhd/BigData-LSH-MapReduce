# Big Data Homework: LSH and MapReduce Implementations

This repository contains implementations for two fundamental big data concepts: Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for finding similar items, and a rating analysis task using the MapReduce paradigm.

## Part 1: Finding Similar Users with LSH

This section implements the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique to efficiently find pairs of users with similar tastes from the Yelp dataset. The goal is to identify users who have reviewed a similar set of businesses.

### Methodology
1.  **Shingling**: User data is transformed into a set of businesses they have reviewed.
2.  **MinHashing**: A signature matrix is created using MinHash functions to produce a compact representation of each user's set of reviewed businesses. This allows for a fast approximation of Jaccard Similarity.
3.  **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**: The MinHash signatures are partitioned into bands. Candidate pairs are generated by hashing bands and identifying users who hash to the same bucket in at least one band.
4.  **Similarity Check**: The Jaccard Similarity of the candidate pairs is calculated to identify truly similar pairs above a certain threshold.

This approach allows for finding similar users in sub-quadratic time, making it scalable for large datasets.

## Part 2: Movie Rating Analysis with MapReduce

This part uses a from-scratch MapReduce implementation to process the MovieLens dataset and answer a specific analytical question: **"For each movie, what is the highest rating given by a female user?"**

### Methodology
-   **Mapper**: The `mapper` processes the `users.txt` and `movies.txt` datasets. It emits the `movie_id` as the key. The value is the `rating` if the user is female ('F'), otherwise it's ignored.
-   **Reducer**: The `reducer` receives a `movie_id` and a list of all ratings given to that movie by female users. It then finds and outputs the maximum rating from this list.

This task demonstrates how to perform a distributed join and aggregation using the MapReduce programming model.
